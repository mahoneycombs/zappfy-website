          <p>Hi! My name is Jared, I go by JD professionally, and I created Zappfy in 2017 and focused on implementing software solutions
            in a variety of domains without the overhead costs I had experienced as an employee. Over the years I've had the opportunity
            to learn from an amazing set of colleagues, clients, mentors, and managers spanning from Silicon Valley to Singapore.</p>
          <p>I built Zappfy to
          help organizations make sense of their technical landscape while solving business problems. But to be honest, when I started out,
          I avoided uncertainty by sticking to the confines of the languages, frameworks, and platforms that I knew so well, extending only when necessary.</p>
          <p><strong>This worked.</strong>
            I built good software with teams and delivered functional apps for companies that weren't sure how to proceed or execute on their vision.</p>
          <p>However, as my knowledge has matured and my skills have evolved, I have found that the highest costs of software development stem from a lack
            of optionality coupled with a lack of understanding around user needs. This informs my approach to work.</p>
          <p>Nowadays I focus less on technology and more on people. People can mean the end user you're designing for, but it can equally mean your internal
            teams, vendors you're working with, or that product manager you tasked with solving challenging problems.</p>
          <p>Building software has always been part art, part science. Sometimes we forget the former in our amateurish pursuit of the latter.</p>
          <p>Let's make art together by prioritizing people: the science will follow.</p>

      <h2 class="headline">Our Vision</h2>
      <h4>
        Transparency and affordability in technology.
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We show you the direct rate we pay our partner freelancers, with any
          corresponding markup we employ to keep the internet on.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not take referral bonuses from vendors. We recommend products
          and services based on the quality and solution fit for those products
          and services in your ecosystem to avoid bias.
        </li>
        <li>
          We embrace iterative feedback loops with end users (or the closest
          proxies of end users) and do not leave you out of the loop.
        </li>
        <li>
          We believe in the practice of software engineering and its value to
          organizations; we do not believe in outsourcing exclusively for cheap
          labor, as this has long been a practice thatâ€™s haunted many industries
          and leads to not only the exploitation of labor but poor outcomes in
          product quality.
